        croissant, French pastry that is typically crescent-shaped, which is the
        origin of its French name. Although there are earlier culinary
        references to ‚Äúcroissants,‚Äù the first recipe for the croissant as it is
        known today emerged only as recently as 1906. The huge growth in
        popularity of the croissant appears to have been a 20th-century
        sensation.The classic crescent-shaped French pastry is made from a
        yeast-based dough, which is rolled and layered to incorporate butter.
        Because of the cost of butter, many bakers use cheaper substitutes such
        as margarine, which means that most bakeries in France offer two types
        of croissants: croissant and croissant au beurre (‚Äúcroissant with
        butter‚Äù). The former tends to be more breadlike, whereas the latter is
        much richer and, predictably, more buttery. A popular habit among bakers
        is to bend the butterless croissant into a distinctive curve while
        straightening out the croissant au beurre so as to distinguish clearly
        between the two.

                  Golden, buttery croissants should be crisp and flaky on the
                  outside and soft and tender on the inside, with a texture that
                  can be almost pulled apart. Croissants are often stuffed with
                  different sweet or savory fillings. The classic sweet-filled
                  croissants use almonds, marzipan, or chocolate, whereas savory
                  croissants might be filled variously with cheese, spinach, or
                  ham.

            Though the croissant‚Äôs Austrian heritage is widely accepted, the
            story of the kipferl‚Äôs origin is also rife with myth. According to
            legend, the kipferl originated in the late 17th Century as a
            celebration of the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire at the
            siege of Vienna. As the story goes, Viennese bakers (who would often
            work in cellars) were up early to start their day‚Äôs work and heard
            the Ottomans attempting to tunnel into the heavily walled city. The
            bakers sounded the alarm, and the Austrians were able to vanquish
            their would-be attackers. To celebrate their heroism, the Viennese
            bakers created the kipferl with its curved shape made to resemble
            the crescent moon of the Ottoman flag. This story, however, is
            widely disregarded, with experts claiming that the kipferl (or
            relatives of it) can be dated as far back as the 13th Century.
            <br />
            <br />
            It was here, known locally as simply ‚ÄúZang‚Äôs‚Äù, that Parisians first
            encountered what would become the croissant. Though Zang‚Äôs was only
            open for two years, his unique Vienneserie products and marketing
            acumen (using newspaper advertising and lavish window displays to
            entice customers) made his kipferl a sensation; so much so that by
            the time Zang‚Äôs closed in 1840, there were already a dozen imitators
            baking his beloved crescent-shaped delicacy.
            <br />
            <br />Regardless of the kipferl‚Äôs origin, how then did this Viennese
            delicacy become France‚Äôs most beloved patisserie item? As you may
            now have come to expect, there are a number of tall tales. One
            legend attributes the kipferl‚Äôs introduction to Paris, having come
            from Austrian-born Marie Antoinette bringing the delicacy over when
            she married King Louis XVI in 1770. This is yet another myth! The
            real birth of the croissant is more accurately attributed to August
            Zang, an Austrian entrepreneur who opened a Viennese-style
            boulangerie in Paris in 1838.

                There are several stories that claim to explain the origins of
                how croissants came to be. Whilst experts have done their best
                to debunk most of these apochryphal tales, one thing that the
                historical evidence shows more definitively is that the story of
                the croissant begins in Austria, not in France.
